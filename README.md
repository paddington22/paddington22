## Hi, I'm Pavel Korolev ðŸ‘‹
I am a junior Python developer.

Recently, I changed my field of expertise, and for the past six months, I have been actively studying Python and coding in it. During this time, I have mastered algorithms and classical data structures, the basics of OOP, and HTML. I also have experience working with the version control system Git and relational databases (PostgreSQL). Using the Django framework, I developed my first project - an online store.

I am currently dedicating a significant amount of my time to learning Django. In the near future, I also plan to learn FastAPI.

I am eager to gain more practical experience and would be delighted to work with you. Please feel free to contact me.
